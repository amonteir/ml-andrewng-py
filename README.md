# Machine Learning Course
This repository contains python implementations of the weekly exercises of the Machine Learning course @ Coursera by Andrew Ng. The course uses Octave or Matlab as programming
language for submitting the asignments and that I am not sharing publicly, though happy to discuss ideas and implementation. Please adhere to the Stanford Honor Code below.   

# Stanford Honor Code
"We strongly encourage students to form study groups, and discuss the lecture videos (including in-video questions). We also encourage you to get together with friends to watch the videos together as a group. However, the answers that you submit for the review questions should be your own work. For the programming exercises, you are welcome to discuss them with other students, discuss specific algorithms, properties of algorithms, etc.; we ask only that you not look at any source code written by a different student, nor show your solution code to other students."
