# Machine Learning Course
This repository contains the python implementations of the weekly exercises of the Machine Learning course @ Coursera by Andrew Ng. 
<br>The course uses Octave/Matlab as programming language for submitting the assignments instead of python. 
<br>Happy to discuss ideas and implementations to get you through the course.  

# Stanford Honor Code
"We strongly encourage students to form study groups, and discuss the lecture videos (including in-video questions). We also encourage you to get together with friends to watch the videos together as a group. However, the answers that you submit for the review questions should be your own work. For the programming exercises, you are welcome to discuss them with other students, discuss specific algorithms, properties of algorithms, etc.; we ask only that you not look at any source code written by a different student, nor show your solution code to other students."
